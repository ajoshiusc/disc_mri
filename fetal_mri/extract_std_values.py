### Tissue Noise Characteristics
The observed SNR pattern (WM > GM) reflects distinct noise characteristics between tissue types in fetal brain reconstruction. Analysis of signal variability revealed that gray matter regions (cortical plate) exhibited higher standard deviation values compared to white matter developmental zones. At TE98 (12 stacks), gray matter showed σ_GM ≈ 141.7 while white matter demonstrated σ_WM ≈ 66.8 (normalized intensity units). This 2.1-fold difference in noise levels explains why white matter achieves higher SNR (4.493) than gray matter (2.472) despite gray matter having higher mean signal intensity (μ_GM > μ_WM, CR = 1.170). Similar patterns were observed across all TE values: TE140 (σ_GM/σ_WM ≈ 2.3), TE181 (σ_GM/σ_WM ≈ 2.0), and TE272 (σ_GM/σ_WM ≈ 2.5). The consistently lower noise in white matter regions likely reflects the more homogeneous developmental architecture of fetal white matter zones compared to the complex cellular organization of the cortical plate during neurogenesis.
